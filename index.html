      <h2>Section One</h2>
      <p>

        Time travel is the hypothetical activity of traveling into the past or future.
        Time travel is a widely recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, 
        particularly science fiction. In fiction, time travel is typically achieved 
        through the use of a hypothetical device known as a time machine. The idea of a
        time machine was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel The Time Machine.It is 
        uncertain if time travel to the past is physically possible, and such travel, if
        at all feasible, may give rise to questions of causality. Forward time travel, 
        outside the usual sense of the perception of time, is an extensively observed 
        phenomenon and well-understood within the framework of special relativity and 
        general relativity. However, making one body advance or delay more than a few 
        milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology.

      <h2>Section Two</h2>
      <p>
        Time travel to the past is theoretically possible in certain general
        relativity spacetime geometries that permit traveling faster than the
        speed of light, such as cosmic strings, traversable wormholes, and 
        Alcubierre drives.The theory of general relativity does suggest a 
        scientific basis for the possibility of backward time travel in certain
        unusual scenarios, although arguments from semiclassical gravity suggest 
        that when quantum effects are incorporated into general relativity, these 
        loopholes may be closed.These semiclassical arguments led Stephen Hawking
        to formulate the chronology protection conjecture, suggesting that the
        fundamental laws of nature prevent time travel, but physicists cannot come
        to a definite judgment on the issue without a theory of quantum gravity to 
        join quantum mechanics and general relativity into a completely unified theory.

      <h2>Section Three</h2>
      <p>
        On the other hand, we have to consider the idea of a consistent causal loop. While 
        equally thought-provoking, this theoretical model of time travel is paradox free. 
        According to physicist Paul Davies, such a loop might play out like this: A math
        professor travels into the future and steals a groundbreaking math theorem. The professor
        then gives the theorem to a promising student. Then, that promising student grows up to
        be the very person from whom the professor stole the theorem to begin with.
